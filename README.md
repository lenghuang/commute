# Commute Fetcher

In the summer of 2023, I was going to move to New York City with two other roommates. When searching for apartments, I wanted a way to quickly gauge what the commutes for certain apartments would be like. However, I ran into a few issues when using StreetEasy. They wouldn't factor for what it looks like to arrive at 9am during working hours. Furthermore, it would only show the overall time. But 30 min in the subway is very different than 10 min in the subway and 20 min of walking! Or even worse, a ferry! :o So I created this quick script that allows you to see the commute for a given location to our three "offices" (Downtown, Midtown East, and Roosevelt Island).
